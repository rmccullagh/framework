* Need to implement other HTTP methods besides GET. Look at Application::run

* Routes callbacks are executed in the order that they are defined.
  Once the framework finds a matching route, it leaves the main loop
  if one route is defined as "/home/:id", and you request the URL /home/:id
  the callback will be executed. ":" char currently is a reserved word
  that has special meaning in a route. Need to implement a way to validate
  that a raw route does or does not contain it. If a raw route does
  have it, validate it, and if it fails die.
