Version 0.0.1

*** Development Only, not stable ***
**  Do not run this with a "live" application, it has not been fully tested. **


This is the development of a new PHP framework. Highly influenced by expressjs.

To get started, get the source, and then use nginx, and route all request to index.php
to the root of the source. Look at nginx.conf

To run correctly, make a directory "log", then change the group of that directory to your username, and www-data
sudo chown ryan:www-data log
